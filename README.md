# Task Management App with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS

Welcome to the **Task Management App**! This is a simple yet powerful application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It allows you to manage a list of tasks, including adding new tasks, editing existing ones, deleting tasks, and sorting or filtering the list. The app uses **JSONPlaceholder** as a mock API to simulate real-world server interactions.

---

## Features

Hereâ€™s what you can do with this app:

1. **Fetch Tasks**: Automatically loads a list of tasks from the mock API when the app starts.
2. **Add New Tasks**: Easily add new tasks with a title and description.
3. **Edit Tasks**: Update the title or description of any task.
4. **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks you no longer need.
5. **Sort Tasks**: Sort the list of tasks by **title** or **ID**.
6. **Filter Tasks**: Search for specific tasks by typing in the filter box.
7. **Responsive Design**: The app looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Mock API Integration

The app uses **JSONPlaceholder**, a free mock API service, to simulate server interactions. Here are the endpoints used:

| Endpoint                | Method | Description                          |
|-------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| `/posts`                | GET    | Fetch the list of tasks.             |
| `/posts`                | POST   | Add a new task to the list.          |
| `/posts/:id`            | PUT    | Update an existing task.             |
| `/posts/:id`            | DELETE | Delete a task from the list.         |
